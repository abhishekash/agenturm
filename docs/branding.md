# Agenturm identity

**A clear view of every agent.**

The logo takes its primary reference from Berlin's TV Tower: a spherical
observation deck on a slender mast, topped with a banded broadcast antenna.
The lavender-purple sphere contains a central hand lens (magnifying glass),
with a single thin observation band below it. Both details are transparent
cutouts. The amber mast rests on a flat foundation. The sphere is circular, not a flattened
saucer, and the shaft has no doorway or decorative cutouts. Strict symmetry
and restrained geometry express confidence, strength, and rigour. The mark
represents a clear vantage point over agent activity, not control of the agents.
The wordmark is simply **Agenturm**.

## Assets

| Asset | Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Tower mark](../media/brand/icon.svg) | App icon, avatar, square placements |
| [Transparent tower](../media/brand/icon-transparent.svg) | Dark backgrounds and overlays |
| [Wordmark](../media/brand/logo.svg) | Dark headers and presentations |
| [Hero](../media/brand/hero.svg) | Presentations and wide placements |
| [Social preview](../media/brand/social-preview.png) | GitHub repository social image, 1280 × 640 |

PNG icon exports are available at 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 pixels.
The SVGs are the editable source. Keep the mark's proportions and leave clear
space around it. At small sizes, use the mark without a wordmark.

## Alpine Ember

| Role | Color | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Charcoal | `#121018` | Canvas |
| Night | `#191621` | Panels |
| Violet grey | `#242030` | Raised surfaces and controls |
| Amber | `#ffbd69` | Active navigation, keyboard focus, current work |
| Lavender | `#c5adff` | Tower sphere, detail headings, and tool inventory |
| Mint | `#86e3b5` | Successful calls and healthy activity |
| Ice | `#86d9ed` | Usage values |
| Frost | `#f6f0e8` | Primary text |
| Slate | `#b9afc5` | Supporting text |
| Rose | `#ff8799` | Failures, accompanied by an explicit status label |

Use color to support text, never as the sole status indicator. Focus remains
visible through borders and selected rows. The identity is static: no flashing
logo or decorative loading animation. The terminal carries the identity as text
only: a bold **Agenturm** wordmark, a slim divider, and the README tagline, all
on a single line. Demo mode adds a filled amber **DEMO** badge. The lockup is
centered horizontally, while connection status stays at the right edge; the full
endpoint is available in its tooltip. Short terminals drop the tagline to leave
the name alone, and the MCP server inventory is hidden to preserve room for the
session and call tables. The footer keeps the full key map, and a few keys —
search, trace, and the command palette — repeat beside the scope control in the
footer's key style, dropping out below 120 columns. No image protocols, emoji
rendering, or Nerd Font is required. Compact layouts use a one-line
identity/status header, task-first session list, and responsive inspector. Usage
and MCP totals remain available in Metrics and MCP Calls rather than taking
persistent header space. Verify contrast when changing palette tokens.

## Terminal themes

The command palette exposes five themes: **Observation** (website-aligned,
the default), **Current** (Alpine Ember), **Bright** (light), **Dark**
(cool charcoal), and **Solarized** (blue-green dark). Open **Ctrl+P → Theme**
to switch. Panels, table rows,
controls, evidence text, and syntax backgrounds follow the selected palette.

## Naming and compatibility

- Product: **Agenturm**
- Repository, Python distribution, and sole installed command: **agenturm**
- JavaScript client: **@agenturm/client**
- Former names: Agent Observatory, Agent Goechala

The `observatory` Python import, `OBSERVATORY_*` settings, telemetry attribute
names, and the default `observatory.db` filename remain compatible. Existing
saved history is reused. The old executable names are not installed; use
`agenturm`.
Package publication and PyPI's Trusted Publisher registration are separate from
the source rename; see [publishing](publishing.md).

## Rebuild

```bash
uv run --with cairosvg python scripts/build_brand_assets.py
```

See [the demo production guide](investigation-video.md) to reproduce the README
video, animated preview, and actual terminal screenshots.

## Design references

The presentation takes cues from [Lazygit's explicit focus styling](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md),
[btop's use of distinct panel accents](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), and
[Glow's typography and color hierarchy](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).
The tower artwork is original. Amber marks the active view; supporting labels
remain neutral, and status always has a text label as well as color.

Primary text, supporting text, status accents, and active-tab text are checked
against their backgrounds for at least 4.5:1 contrast. Inactive decorative borders
are intentionally quieter; focused borders use the bright amber accent.
